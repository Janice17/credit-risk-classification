# Overview of the Analysis
- Purpose of this analysis is to train and evaluate machine learning models based on loan risk. Using a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers and classify the credit risk predictions.  
- The finacial information in the data was focused on loan_status. To predict the loan status are loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks and total debt.  
- Target values of loan_status there are two variables which I have tried to predict. The first set of variables have a value of '0' and these indicate that the loan is healthy. The second set of variables have a value of '1' and these mean that the loan has a high risk of defaulting.  
- The machine learning process used to perform analysis can be found in subsections (split the data into training and testings sets) and (created a logistic regresssion model with the original data).  
- Used the LogisticRegression method model on the origional data. 
## Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
1. Read the csv data into Pandas DataFrame.  
2. Created the labels set (y) from the loan_status column, and then created the features (x) DataFrame from the remaining columns.  
3. Split the data into training and testing datasets by using train_test_split.
## Created a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
1. Fit a logistic regression model by using the training.  
2. Saved the predictions for the testing data labels by using the testing feature data and the fitted model.  
3. Evaluated the model's performance by doing the following:  
- Generated a confusion matrix.  
- Print the classification report.  
4. Answered the question in the notebook.
# Results
This section describes the accuracy scores, the precision, and recall scores of the logistic regression model:  
![alt text](../Classification_Report.png)
- Accuracy is 0.99, this model does a great job in predicting both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan).  
- The precision scores show that the healthy loans were classified correctly as positive 100% of the times. However, the high-risk loans classification was correct only 85% of the times.  
- The recall scores show that for all the times where the loans were actually healthy, 99% of the times they were classified correctly. However, for all the times where the loans were actually high-risk, they were classified correctly 95% of the times.
# Summary
Based on the results above, following summary points can be made:
- The logistic regression model perfoms well as it has a 99% accuracy score.  
- On all metrics the logistic regression of lending data does  a good job based on the classification report and would recommend its use to identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
